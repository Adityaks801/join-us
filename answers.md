1. Self introduction


My name is Aditya KS, and I originally come from a Mechanical Engineering background. My journey into the field of Data Science and Analytics has been both unconventional and transformative.
After a life-changing accident, I had to reevaluate my career path and search for a role that was less physically demanding. During this time, I discovered Data Science—and I was instantly captivated. The more I explored its potential to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful innovation, the more fascinated I became. What started as curiosity quickly turned into an obsession, and I decided to fully immerse myself in this exciting field.
To formalize my transition, I completed a Master’s in Data Science program at SMEC Labs Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and technologies, including Python, Hadoop, TensorFlow, Spark, and advanced machine learning frameworks.
Over the years, I have worked on several impactful projects, such as:
Humanoid Robot Simulation: Developing a clinical reception robot prototype with advanced capabilities like crowd detection, path planning, gesture recognition, and multilingual NLP.

Mental Health Support Platform: Creating an intelligent web platform powered by AI/ML for personalized recommendations and multilingual user interaction.

Data Science Projects: Conducting exploratory data analysis and implementing machine learning models on datasets such as Airbnb bookings, credit card fraud detection, and heart attack prediction.

I specialize in programming languages like Python and Java, Big Data tools like Hadoop and Spark, and visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. My background in Mechanical Engineering, combined with my relentless passion for Data Science, has given me a unique perspective and problem-solving approach.
